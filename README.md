# Run your own TransparencyCamp!

Do you think TransparencyCamp is awesome and want to host one of your own? You're in luck. We consider TCamp to be open-source â€” this repository contains a detailed how-to guide, and we'd also love for you to use the TCamp name.

Please see [HOWTO](/HOWTO.md) for the how-to guide, and [LICENSE](/LICENSE) for the open-source license.

_Note:_ Currently, some parts of the how-to guide are sourcing assets like images or documents from [transparencycamp.org](https://transparencycamp.org/). At some point soon, those assets will be copied into this repository so that the entire guide's source material can be found here.
